Most quiescent galaxies are found to be HI-poor. Thus it is believed that quiescent galaxies cease their star formation due to the lack of cold gas. However, we found 49 quenched but HI-rich (**RR**) galaxies from 30000+ existing HI sources, indicating that quenched galaxies can be HI-rich, but such case is very rare. <u>([Li et al. 2024, ApJ, 963, 86](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...963...86L/abstract))</u>

Our analysis to this RR sample shows that they have nearly the same optical properties as those normal quenched HI-poor galaxies, but reside in lower density environments. Their HI disk is probably much more extended than the stellar component. Angular momentum is likely to play a role in the formation of RR galaxies by preventing HI gas from falling into the galaxy center. As a result, the enormous HI gas can not convert into stars efficiently.
