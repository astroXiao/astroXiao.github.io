I'm leading a deep HI targeted survey of a sample of nearby red massive galaxies ($NUV-r>5, M_*>10^{10}M_{\odot},0.01<z<0.02$) using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) in China. This survey is designed to observe the HI 21cm emission line of target galaxies down to a limit of $\rm \log M_{HI}/M_*=-3$. The outstanding sensitivity of FAST ensures that we can reach this limit within a reasonable integration time. The output data will tell us how much HI gas do red massive galaxies possess, and how these galaxies ceased their star formation activity.
