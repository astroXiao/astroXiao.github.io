I'm now a visiting scholar at the Department of Astronomy, Tsinghua University. My research aims to understand the role of atomic hydrogen (HI) gas in star formation and galaxy evolution using multi-wavelength observations as well as numerical simulations. I'm particularly interested in radio observations, which can tell us the properties of cold gas (HI, molecular gas) in and around galaxies. In this website you can find my CV, published papers, and get an overview of my research.
